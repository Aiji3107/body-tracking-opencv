# Body Tracking Project

Welcome to the **Body Tracking Project**! This project is designed to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to track and analyze human body movements in real-time. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast in the field of computer vision, this project will provide you with the tools and insights needed to build, test, and deploy sophisticated body tracking models.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Body Tracking Project** aims to:
- **Detect and track human body movements** using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms.
- **Analyze body posture and movements** in various scenarios, including sports, healthcare, and virtual reality applications.
- Provide a **flexible framework** for experimenting with different models and tracking techniques.
- Offer **real-time processing** capabilities for live video streams or pre-recorded footage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Multi-Person Tracking**: Track multiple people simultaneously in a single frame with high accuracy.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Capable of analyzing live video streams with minimal latency.
- **Customizable Models**: Easily switch between different pre-trained models or train your own.
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Generate detailed reports and visualizations of tracked movements and postures.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Run the project on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üß© Project Structure

- **`/notebooks`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and demonstration purposes.
- **`/src`**: The core source code of the project, including model definitions and utility functions.
